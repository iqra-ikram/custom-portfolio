   <p>I am currently a student at the Global Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Computing (GIAIC),<br />
    where I am honing my skills in web development. With a strong passion for technology and problem-solving,<br />
    I am learning to create dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications. <br />
     My studies at GIAIC have provided me with a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development, <br />
      and I am continuously building on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web technologies.  <br />
      As I progress through my education, I am excited to expand my skill set and apply my learning to real-world projects. <br />
       My goal is to combine creativity with technical expertise to build seamless, innovative digital experiences.
